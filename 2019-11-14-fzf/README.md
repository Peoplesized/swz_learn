# FZF tutorial


• Explored how to use fuzzy finder (fzf)

• Fuzzy finder is an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.

•  Useful commands include 

    `CTRL-R` searches the history of commands in tmmux mode
    `CTRL-T` searches the file history in tmmux mode
    `vi -o `fzf`` opens selected file in vim (can also be used with any editor e.g `code -o `fzf`` for vscode)

• One caveat is that fzf does not use regular expressions to search files, commands and directories.
