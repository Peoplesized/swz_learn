Let’s do something similar to last week.

Use the pomodoro technique again to help manage your time, and spend up to 25 mins on each challenge.

Challenges:

1. Without using the internet, find out about something    you didn’t know much/anything about before that is tech-related. Hint: if you have to, you can use a computer  (man pages or tldr, etc), but try not to! There are a pile of books on table in my office that miht help.
2. Using the internet, find out about something you didn’t know much/anything about before that is tech-related: blockchain, quantum computing, functional programming, facial recognition, refactoring, domain-driven deverlopment, document-driven development, OCaml, Reason, Elm, imba, Rust, Go, etc, etc. If you’re stuck, look at  hackernoon.com  or  news.ycombinator.com  (but don’t get stuck there - pick something and move on!).
3. Find out one thing you didn’t know anything about that is totally not work- or tech-related: what is a tardigrade, what was the ‘terracotta army’, what is impeachment, why does it rain, how does a plane’s wing work, etc, etc. If you’re stuck, the  Wikipedia front page  can give you some ideas (but don’t get stuck there either - pick something and move on!). Aim to finish this one a few minutes early, then take a longer break - go outside and smell the roses, or the rain.
4. Create a 2 minute presentation on A or B. You’ll need at least 1 visual, so not just talking. Use any tools you like: e.g. Keynote might be already on your machine. If you don’t find any suitable tools already installed, then improvise: e.g. show a series of screenshots/photos, or see if you can display images in VS Code. We’ll do a presentation session after lunch.

If you’re done early on any of it, you can review the ‘learn’ sessions and repo so far, tidy up any of the READMEs or try out anything you didn’t have time to before.
