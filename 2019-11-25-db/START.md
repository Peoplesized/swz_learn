1. Create a query that groups, aggregates and joins the records and countries tables (in attached DB), so that we get a table showing total number of records for each country in a structure like this:

| country  | records_count |
|----------|---------------|
| Namibia  | 5             |
| Botswana | 15            |
| Zimbabwe | 25            |
