# INSTRUCTIONS
@Gift N @manqoba.sukati  Do you want to spend some time this morning thinking up some projects you could work on?

They should be:

•	specific user-domain problems (i.e. not pure technical questions like ‘how do I get this command working’)
•	solvable within a few mornings of work
•	related to what we do, but don’t have to be solving a work problem

The problems should not dictate the tech used to solve them - make sure the problem makes sense to a user (even if _you) are the user). We will take a little time to review the tech options, but whereas with work products we’re usually looking for the shortest route A-to-B, for these projects we might look more for a detour to see what we can learn.
