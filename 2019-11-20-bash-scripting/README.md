## Bash Scripting Tutoial

* Explored how to write and execute bash scripts

* Bash scripts can be created by performing the following steps:

    - Create a file with a valid file name and a `.sh` extension i.e `touch <filename>.sh`

    - Open the file editor and add `#!/bin/zsh`  at the top of the file. This tells zsh that the file is an executable file.

    - Write the desired code

* To give the current user permission to execute a bash script simply run `chmod +x <filename>.sh`

* The script can now be ran by executing `./<filename.sh>`.
