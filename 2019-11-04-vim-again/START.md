# 2019-11-04-vim-again Instructions

We’ve been working on remote servers a bit, so think it’s worth doing some more vim.

Take 25 mins or so to do some or all of the following:

1.	If it looks useful, install https://github.com/amix/vimrc, and review some of the commands and shortcuts
2.	Watch this http://vimcasts.org/episodes/operating-on-search-matches-using-gn/ - it covers one specific feature, but recaps a bunch of useful things - e.g. I don’t use the . command to repeat previous, but it’s very useful!
3.	Review the cheatsheet at http://vimsheet.com/, and pick out a couple of useful commands

Then take your new skill(s) and apply to either one of the other learns from this week, or something else you’re working on.
