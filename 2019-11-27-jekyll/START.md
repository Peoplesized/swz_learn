# Basics:

1.	Install jekyll.
2.	Scaffold a new site (e.g.  jekyll new my-awesome-site)
3.	Get it serving locally
4.	Create a new page (markdown not HTML) with some content, and add a link to the landing page

# A bit advanced:

1.	Add a data file or a collection, and use them in your site.
2.	Figure out which version of ruby you’re running, and where it’s installed (type command?)
