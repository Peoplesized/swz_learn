Steps:

1.	Find a countdown timer. There are plenty of apps and websites, but for today a timer on your phone should work fine.
2.	Repeat the following steps 4 times:
a. set a timer for 25 minutes,
b. pick the first/next task
c. when the 25 min timer goes, stop what you’re doing, take a short break (up to 5 minutes) - during the break, stand up, walk around, anything to change your focus.
d. when 5 mins is up, start again at step a

Tasks:
A. Read up on the pomodoro technique: here or anywhere else on the internet.
B. Review the ‘learn’ sessions and repo so far, tidy up any of the READMEs or try out anything you didn’t have time to before.
C. Find out about something you didn’t know much/anything about before that is tech-related: blockchain, quantum computing, functional programming, facial recognition, refactoring, domain-driven deverlopment, document-driven development, OCaml, Reason, Elm, imba, Rust, Go, etc, etc. If you’re stuck, look at hackernoon.com or news.ycombinator.com (but don’t get stuck there - pick something and move on!).
D. Find out one thing you didn’t know anything about that is totally not work- or tech-related: what is a tardigrade, what was the ‘terracotta army’, what is impeachment, why does it rain, how does a plane’s wing work, etc, etc. If you’re stuck, the Wikipedia front page can give you some ideas (but don’t get stuck there either - pick something and move on!). Aim to finish this one a few minutes early, then take a longer break - go outside and smell the roses, or the rain.
