## VSCODE Tutorial

* VSCODE keybindings are used to define shortcuts to performing a particular task. For example rather than navigating by file to click the open file menu one can simply press `cmd + o` to open a file 

* VSCODE comes with default key bindings but they can be changed.

     - To view all keyboard shortcuts press `cmd + k + cmd + s`
     - The resulting list also allows shortcuts to be changed.

* The following are useful VSCODE default keybindings
