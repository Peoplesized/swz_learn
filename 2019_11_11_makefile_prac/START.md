[gift.mavuso](twist-mention://326044) and [manqoba.sukati](twist-mention://303090) why not take a look at `makefile` this morning?

Look at http://makefiletutorial.com/.

You might be surprised at what it can do…

Want to see if you want work out how to get it to _automate_ some of the procesing we were doing yesterday with `jq` and `json2csv`. For example, can it take an argument that you can substitute for `nam` or `bwa`?
