## Debugging Tutorial

- Explored how to debug code running in chrome from VS code.

- Install the following useful VS code extensions for debugging:
    
    * [Debug your JavaScript code in the Chrome browser, or any other target that supports the Chrome Debugger protocol](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)

    * [Launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

- To start debugging go to the `menu -> debug -> start debugging`. 

- The above will generate a `.vscode` folder with `launch.json` file. 

- The launch.json file can be edited to meet the configurations of the debugger. More information about launch.json can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome).

- To inspect variables you need to add a breakpoint inside a function
