# 2019-12-05-cli-with-python 

You’re going to write a simple command-line application in Python. The exact functionality doesn’t matter too much, there are some good ideas in the tutorials below. I’d pick something that takes at least one simple argument (i.e. not an object or a file), and gives back a result that depends on that input.

Try not to get sidetracked by the internal functionality of the application - instead I would focus on getting as far through the list of tutorials below as possible, even if it’s just with a very simple application. The goal today is to learn how to wrap any application as a CLI, not to build any specific CLI.
